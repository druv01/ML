" simple fun game this is the type of game that can be easy and difficult at the same time. each game is determined by how the candies drop, so sometimes you can fly through a level and other times you can be stuck for days. a good time filler when you have 5 mins to spare.",1
" awesome it's a great game that will test your patience. you may have to spend real money if you can't wait to move on or lack the skill needed to complete a stage. there are more than 1,000 stages, so far i'm up to level 82 and each level has at least 15 stages.",1
 1 of our 2 favorite games! it is a delight playing this modern classic that is constantly renewing our interest.,1
" suggestion. i given 5 stars to this game,  because i like it very much, but i have a suggestion to improve this game plz. when a color er bomb is mash with i striped candy, all of candies of the same color become striped and blast. but same action with tha rapped candy does not act like this. as works in candy crush soda saga. plz work on it. thanx. muhammad hanif karachi pakistan. no reply from admin, why ???????",1

 awesomness this game is awesome but tricky with ice i play all day trying to win i might say i'm good at this game but my friends and family!ily look over my shoilder and say your playing the game wrong but i love this game,1

 fun diversion good game to take a quick break from whatever you're doing. nice test of your ability to see and hear what's coming ahead and react. the latest update with the winter map improves the core game quite a bit.,1
 very adventurous game i love it very nice thrilling game everyone should download it and play !!!!! very addictive game i just stick on it good graphics and sound improved by the previous partđđđđđđđđ,1
" nice game.... its simply amazing...but i would like it better if we had custom options for graphics. it runs extremely smooth but the developer should go easy on the memory that is, it takes more space now than ever before. but overall its an epic game.",1
" know how to get the account back. you have to delete clash of clans,then you download it again, then you look on the upper left corner of the screen, then you see already have a village?'' then you press it,then you will have your village.",1
" no longer a casual game the current version of the game makes it too hard to play casually anymore. expect to spend 4-6 hours a day, just to stay afloat.",1
 google chrome app it allows me to browse the internet on a phone of all things. seriously guys we're living in the future. 5 stars because it always works.,1
 totally loved it but....... how to open new tab in lollipop. in kitkat to open new tab we have to swipe down form up but after i updated my software i can't find it. plz reply fast,1
 chrome browser (update: 3) ... barrister akash. it's a fine application i am not only like this application but also i am love thi application. essay browsing & perfectly working . so i have given this application 5 star (*****) akash.,1
" the best i agree totally with the last poster. chrome is simply the best for android   period. i've tried all the other crap out there and yeah they have some more features none of which i ever used. i have chrome on my laptop and pc and all of this is synced together. simple, direct and to the point and that's what i like and don't forget very fast.",1
 good... chrome is improving...! but there are some problems    1)we can't change the default download location.   2)app size is high.   3)can't save web pages for offline viewing.    4)can't stop loading web pages easily.,1
 i love viber viber is an excellent chatting software. only one tiny negative comment for you. sometimes it takes a delay to reach message even online.  stickers are so cool...,1
" excellent as long as you have good service, it works great. use it to talk to my family in chile and asia.  it cuts out if you don't have wifi or excellent service.",1
" viber about the voice messages and chatting, viber is the best app in the market. about the calling services - even messenger performs better. the app isn't optimised for wi-fi usage. about the newest version (until 23.12.2015) there is a new option introduced, which allows you to see which of your friends have seen your message in a group chat. well, it is not working and this makes me a little bit mad - finally the function was introduced in viber and still not working properly.",1
 viber s.a.r.l. this app helps me to stay in contact while also having video options and picture options. really nice app and pretty stable running. just a few video and audio issues as well as video and call drops which can be annoying. sometimes the app is unstable but is mostly attributed to network issues rather than the app itself. i recommend this app.,1
" so far nice and useful but... please, introduce option for choosing who and in which group someone can add you, hate when people put you in group with bunch of strangers sharing some irelative stuff without my approval or knowledge, otherwise, app rocking!",1
 great app love it. does what it says. of course it's going to be slow if the connection isn't fast enough. it works well for me and my family who are overseas.,1
 excellent reception amazing app that lets you keep in touch with family and friends without the worry of expensive mobile bills.,1
" does what it says it does, but chat heads have limitations. the issue i have almost everyday is that when a conversation is open in a chat head, you can not paste what is copied to your clipboard. everything is works fine enough.",1
"  a avid fan of wapp; thats what we call it..  a recommendation.. if u guys can include a feature in which i can stay offline even when the internet connectivity is on.. right now if the internet is on, i keep getting msgs even though i want to stay offline n receive no msgs... please work on this.. rest u people rock đ",1
 whatsapp i use this app now that blackberry messenger has basically gone away. my friends & family live all over the world. this really helps keep us in touch!,1
  occasionally i won't receive a notification of a message(s) so i don't know that someone has replied until i actually open the app and then suddenly lots of messages come through... 5 stars if that can be fixed,1
" it's ok !!! only 1 request... its been now more than 1-2 yrs for whts app but desperately waiting for feature which shows active or live whts app users from contacts. if whatsapp add this feature, then 101% sure whatsapp will rock... !!!!! đđđ",1
" add :  search people if you don't have the persons number , but they have whatsapp you should be able to search their name and then , add them or something . then it would be 5 stars ...",1
 its really good but.. not everyone in your address book is exactly a friend.. sometimes u dont want certain people to see ua status or dps... even if u knw them well... so if there could be an additional feature like a favourite list or something like that i would give it a 5 star fo sure...,1
" very nice app best feature is all friends get in touch with it.. runs well during roaming and with low signal.. i hope to see some improvement as in group chatting if we have tag feature or topic hashtag feature within the group, so that we can refer to a particular topic in discussion , just like in twitter etc.. but within the group not public ..would be great.",1
" good its very good to use .   but i found some fualts .  while writing lengthy status ,the words which we enter at starting will not be visible. so to edit those words we should slide through the text we have written .  so make status editing line step by step instead a single line.",1
 great app but... i heard that apple added some amazing emojis but i've been complaining about not seeing some emojis my iphone friend users send and it bothers me. so can you just add those new emojis please? thank you.,1
 for storage setting you guyz should work on storage options of whatsapp everything goes on internal memory i am not able to transfer my media files to sd card otherwise app is cool!!!,1
 love it but there should be switch off or sign out button having a sign out option helps you maintaining your personal space. you can keep a check on the constant addiction and usage of this service and it can help you in striking a balance between your personal and social life.,1
" what the heck?! can't get status updates to be in chronological order...half of my comments don't post...it worked fine before the last update...keeps kicking me out of the app for no reason.  won't let me tag people without their name being all jumbled. if i edit a post, it shows the unedited version at the top of my feed. i'm 2 seconds away from uninstalling.",0
 its suck. any time when i want to see something error will come could not open check your internet satting. else i am using all other applications and other things on net hance i am using 4g network. realy very suck.,0
" connection issues everytime i try and click on a link or profile i keep getting can not refresh. it does this whether its on wifi , lte, 4g so i'm finding myself having to continuously close app from multitasking and re load it periodically.",0
" external links are not working after updated to latest version.. could not able to open any links on facebook .. it's says connect to network after some time , plz check your network connection .. same time my connection is 4g network is at full speed .. plz fix this issue asap ..thanks",0
" fix this please... i've tried editing two of my profile pictures in the past month and each time i do.. it doesn't post it, but it also doesn't go away. it fades out the picture and it's always at the top of my time line. now i have one from december 14th, and the second one from tonight at the top of my time line and it won't let me delete them, or do anything about it. and it's really buggin' me. please fix this.",0
" buggy when i edit a post through the mobile app, that post freezes and even restarting the phone doesn't resolve / unfreeze. this doesn't happen via the desktop app on my pc, not did it happen with previous android app version.",0
" connection issues app always says can't refresh now, try later which in particular has to do with the net. but my wifi works well enough. i can even play online games. i can refresh my feed at ig and twitter so why can't i refresh my fb feed? fix it please.",0
" i can't get back on facebook it's my email thats wrong or my password. no matter what i do it just sucks because, i really want to talk to my grandchildren. that's the only way i can see or hear from them most of the time.",0

" error i cannot edit my post with pictures. the moment i do, it will not change after save and it appears like when ur uploading but not yet done post in news feed and still there until i did reinstall the app. this still happens even.",0
  whenever i post an update and then try to edit it when i hit save it tells me the post is no longer available and may have been removed yet the original post is still on my page...please fix issue,0
" keeps updating updates all the time, slows my phone as it's doing it to a crawl. installs for like 3 minutes. and the updates never produce anything different or anything of use. the only app on my phone that i have issues with.",0
" won't load everytime i try to use facebook, well lately. it says trouble loading in every aspect. it's been doing this for 2 days i've tried restarting my phone. closing the app. it doesn't work",0
  i wish posts popped up in the order they were posted and not get bumped up to the top every time someone comments on it. i end up seeing the same ones over and over even though they are old and missing newer ones.,0

"  i have had to uninstall this app twice this week because whenever i try to edit a post, the post doesn't edit and just stays gray and stuck in the loading process forever. my o.c.d. can't handle that :-(",0
" profile issues samsung galaxy s4 active: so every time i post a pic on fb it says not available and i can't even edit it! it shows some gray part on top. plzz fix it. i would of rated a 5, but since this happened. i rated 2...",0

"  i can't send or read a message from facebook because the message icon has gone, it replaced by a messenger icon on top, so everytime i received a message i have to go to browser to see it, because i dont have a messenger app. and sometimes i cant even read a message at all because i dont always have a wifi connection.  i really hate it since i've been using mobile data sometimes. hope yu can fix it soonest.",0
 app doesn't work after latest upgrade the facebook app refuses to work on my mobile data (3g) after the latest upgrade! it says it cannot connect right now.,0
 ⭐⭐⭐ when will this app be created to automatically start at the top with new posts instead of having to scroll through days of old tweets to get to the top! the only social app that does that! such a headache!,0

" video issues sometimes videos uploaded from places like vine won't load and will play but the screen will show grey. fix please, i don't know if others have this issue, but i am on my samsung s6 and it is doing this.",0
"  i enjoy twitter but i'm extremely annoyed that i can't swipe left or right through an accounts twitter pictures as easily as before, now just tapping the picture takes me to the whole tweet. i have to be super cautious to not accidently tap the picture while i'm swiping. it's incredibly annoying. please go back to how it was before, if i were to want see the whole tweet just touch the caption.",0
" having a headache because of this enough with the limits on this app, okay? i was trying to get rid of some tweets on my account and it's telling me 'cannot retweet status' or when i try and tweet something: 'failed to send tweet'. like, seriously?",0
 fix it dammit! why is my push notifications not appearing! i have 125 people enabled but i only get a tweet for every 5 minutes instead of all of them at the same time. i reinstalled the app countless times but they don't appear ar all. ive already missed 20 tweets in other 1 minute and i shouldve got notified for them all but i only got 1 for 1 tweet. fix this update im not liking it!,0
" we have a problem. so i've noticed that twitter will let me like nonspecific things until i'm blue in the face, but liking certain specific things get me booted from the app and i have to log back in. let me repeat that. like certain specific things gets me logged out and i have to log back in. what's going on, twitter support?",0
" came here to rate this app to give 5 stars for good optimization for android this is one of the only apps that i open and close and it actually clears fully from ram and does not use up cpu power, unlike facebook and its messenger using up ram and cpu.",0
"  i don't get notifications from people anymore. also, the number of notifications i got doesn't go away after i have checked it, it kind of just... stays there.",0
" the new update sucks i hate that they switched favorite to like , i love twitter so much but it's turning into facebook real fast, i previously rated it 5 stars but right now i'm rating it 1 star due to te next update, i'll rate it 5 again once the change is made, until then, if you want a second facebook experience feel free to download.",0
" the new updates are cool but ... whenever i try to favourite a tweet now, it closes the app saying unfortunately, twitter has stopped. maybe it's just my android idk",0
" sony xperia z1 very good as always, but since last update i can't seem to be able to change the ringtone. reverts back to default",0
" the app made me i'm rating it because of a pop up on the app,but i like twitter so i'm going to give it 5 stars. the only thing i don't like is the fact that i can't edit posts,f-ing instagram can but twitter doesn't have option wtf",0
 bug in changing notification sound i gave 1 so developers may look at it now. this bug is here since long time as i checked in internet. please take a look at it and send a reply or update. (handset : note 5). hope to see the update and change my rating to 5 again.,0
"  twitter is great to connect with my classmates, as i'm on exchange at the moment. however, i cannot view who's liked my posts. it will say there's 9 likes, but will only show me 3. also, the notifications aren't very good, sometimes it won't tell me if someone has followed me or if they've liked/retweeted one of my posts.",0
 you don't say what the updates are please take 1 minute and tell us what and why we are updating and not leave the same old message there!,0
" good but not the better i can't see the videos sometimes, the notifications are bad and always the app isn't responding. this actually is the worst update. please check it",0
 why is there so much space? there is so much white space and everything is so spaced out. also the notifications are always late.,0
 dont download not enough trump memes too much netflix and chill (stop already please). if you are looking for dumb girls that tweet everything that goes through their heads then this app is for you. #blessup,0
" good ui ux and helpful in governance looking the fact that indian government specially indian railway and its officials are using twitter app rigorously for assistance and services , i am installing it. twitter is changing the way of governance in world's biggest democracy india. team twitter should also look to make twitter better and friendly for governance point of view, if any possibility persists for same.",0
 awsome great  type of social media nothing wrong with it it used to crash on my phone but since the update its doesnt even lag a bit pleaz get,0
" videos and notifications my videos haven't been working for a long time on this app. whenever i try to watch a video someone else has posted, its black and white and all glitchy. i sometimes have no way of fixing it. next, i haven't been getting notifications in the app. i get them on my status bar, but when i go on the app i don't get a little number by the bell.",0
 following back it doesn't let me follow people that have followed me back.. and also the amount of people following and followers is also incorrect.... overall it is a live appp,0
" notifications not working i don't get notify about anything, new followers, retweet, likes. non of that and yes i've enabled all the notifications in the settings but nothing happened :(",0
 can you say ads every time i open a tweet there's an ad sitting at the bottom. they appear ridiculously frequently throughout my feed. i get that developers are trying to make a living but come on this is so excessive,0
 needs an actual update! twitter slows down. tweets continue to not even send. it takes a long time to load a tweet and the timeline. i have to use the moblie site version to actually use twitter.,0
" please include membership when viewing lists. i'm on samsung android, and i don't know if this applies with android users in general, but this app version doesn't seem to include the option of seeing what member a user belongs to in viewing lists. it's available on web browser though. please consider including members of list option in the app.",0

" poor customer service the heart button crashes the app whenever i hit it. hasn't been fixed ever since its introduction. within weeks my rate dropped to 1 star, unfortunately",0
" really great! twitter is an amazing app which i use frequently each day. i do have problems with it though. [this is personal preference] whenever i refresh the page, it gives me a tweet with the subtext [twitter name] follows [twitter name] and it happens every time i refresh, so can you only do it once since it clogs my feed with it whenever i want to see new tweets? othe than that its fine.",0
" notification so much update in a every week, but notification still suck. it stuck when app destroyed by system and won't appear when app started. why?",0
" so much room for improvement... the twitter app has been around for several years and yet it still hasn't lived up to its full potential. here's an example: how don't we have the capability to save gifs and videos? not only that, but it'd be cool if we can customize and have different layouts and appearances. simple updates like those would make this app so much better, not lame ones like changing favorites to likes. hopefully these ideas can be considered for 2016.",0
" bugs with contact syncing very frustrated. after having this app work fine for a couple years, i get an update that screwed up my contacts. i've read others' comments and the supposed solutions, including uninstalling and reinstalling the app. for a brief few hours last night, it appeared to re-sync my linkedin contacts back to my phone contacts. today, gone again. in any case, even when the contacts came back, all my previously set up shortcuts to those contacts were disabled. can you fix this linkedin? i use a samsung galaxy 3s.",0
 unexpected! the new update doesn't let you change your profile pic. and the profile pic can't be seen properly after selecting. fix it!,0
"  agree with new ui being too much like fb. also, there is literally no way to modify the app settings. the only option given is to view your linkedin apps. why was this removed? major necessity when you're getting spammed everytime someone posts an update.",0
" issues setting up. works fine now had issues with registering verification email initially. eventually did it via the browser than the app. the app works fine now once set up, do like it.",0
" sort it out why can i not get my networks posts in recent order on my mobile app? on my pc it happens, why am i looking at post from 1day ago before  posts say happening 1 hour ago? this is so annoying, how do you sort it out? also your help centre on mobile  is not working hence i have had to resort to this. what is going on?",0
" samsung note 4 - awesome business platform! please consider adding an edit option in addition to delete for our posts. just in case we'd like to correct a mistake, rather than delete the whole thing.",0
"  new version makes it harder to use linkedin especially find the groups you subscribe to and comment in them.  submitting issues doesn't seem to work in the mobile app, the submit button is never enabled. this last update was a loser!",0
" great code but arrogant company linkedin should be proper stewards of the database they have created. and ensure their customers get optimum use. too many gotchas; no cut and paste from messages, closed api's, etc. pretty narrow minded.",0
" better user interface, worse quality the user interface is definitely better now but at the same time there is a bug concerning synchronising the contacts with the phone contacts, and even when that bug got fixed the contact photo doesn't get shown any more in contrary to previous releases!!!",0
" don't like the new look looks like a cheap dating site now. professional vibe is gone, poor facebook knockoff is here to stay. it's not just the aesthetics but the design as well. simple things, like viewing my connections or viewers, require more time, more taps, and more effort than before. others' connections are listed seemingly randomly, making it arduous to find anyone. it's worse on iphone, where speed is at a snail's pace. linkedin has lost its identity, and if it continues in this direction, it will lose its userbase too.",0
" no respect for privacy linkedin takes advantage of how android manages permissions as well as using an persistent opt out mechanism to aggresively scan your phone's contacts in order to constantly nag about inviting them whilst the app harvests your data. the practices are unethical and makes one question how the company treats private data. linkedin is an important tool to use today but with the way the company behaves, it is better to uninstall the app and rely on the web version when its needed.",0
 so unstable after daily updates had it 4 stars for a long time. this week there were daily updates and the latest one didn't fix my problem. i get a pure white screen upon launch. that would be fine if this was a  flashlight app. i uninstalled and reinstalled. still a flashlight.,0
" good app but......... why do post come up in a random order on the home screen, i have 4 day old posts at the top and have to scroll down to find new posts which are buried between 1 day to 1 week old posts, it needs to have an option for what order you want the posts in.",0
 bad app for a great site linkedin is great but the app sucks. i always have problems opening the app. most of the times it asks me to retry or try later because the feed never loads. there are a bunch of other bugs.,0
" facebook ripoff used to see my connections new connections in news feed, now all i see is silly opinion posts.  no longer a networking site at all :-(",0
 not able to see recently connected people hi i am not able to see the recently connected people in the notification tab.from where i can see the people with whom i connected recently.,0

" down to 1 star after backward redesign this app design was perfectly adequate as of fall 2015, then one of these useless all new! redesigns was perpetrated.  now the old controls that let me manage the notification sound (silent, vibrate, etc.) are nowhere to be found.  had to turn off notifications totally to keep my phone quiet. that is unforgivably incompetent.  i find the overall design more confusing than prior layout, as many other reviewers do.   boo!  from 4 stars to 1.",0
